Probabilistic Robotics

What Is It?
-----------
This is a collection of modules written to demonstrate ideas from the book
'Probabilistic Robotics' by Thrun, Burgard, and Fox. The aim is to implement
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) for a simulated robot in a simple
environment. At this time the simulated robot is capable of Monte Carlo
Localization based on rangefinder data.

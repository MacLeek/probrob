Probabilistic Robotics

What Is It?
-----------
This is a collection of modules written to demonstrate ideas from the book
'Probabilistic Robotics' by Thrun, Burgard, and Fox. The aim is to implement
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) for a simulated robot in a simple
environment. At this time the simulated robot is capable of Monte Carlo
Localization based on rangefinder data.

Usage
----------
Run robot.py to watch the robot navigate to a goal using Monte Carlo 
Localization. The first run with any map will take a while to compute ray
 traces, which are cached for future runs.

File List
-----------
locate.py
mapdef.py
mcl.py
ogmap.py
robot.py

TO DO
----------
Add obstacle avoidance. Right now the robot uses the obstacles for navigation,
but will happily crash right into them... which crashes the program.

Add sliding mode.

Implement SLAM.
